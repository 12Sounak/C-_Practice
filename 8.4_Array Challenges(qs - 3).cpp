//8.4_Array Challenges(qs - 3)
/* Problem  - 
   An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences 
   between consecutive integers are equal. for ex- [9,10],[3,3,3], and [9,7,5,3] are 
   arithmetic arrays, while[1,3,3,7] , [2,1,2], and [1,2,4] are not arithmetic arrays.
   
   Satasvatihas an array of N non negative integers. The i-th integer of the arrat is Ai. She
   wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic sub-array from her array that has maximum length. please
   help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic sub array.

/*Input - The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test
case begin with a line containing the integer N. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai.

Output - for each test case, out one line containing Case #x:y, where x is the test case number
(starting from 1) and y is the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic sub array.
